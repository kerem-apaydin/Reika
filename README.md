# Reika (Core)

This repository hosts the foundational code for **Reika**. It serves as the base framework for the bot, containing the main entry point and essential utility structures.

This is just the beginning—the core logic is here, but specific private modules (admin tools, custom logic) are kept separate.

## What's Inside?

- **Base Architecture:** The skeleton code to get the bot running.
- **Modular System:** Setup for loading/unloading cogs dynamically.
- **Core Utilities:** Basic UI and helper functions (`helper.py`).

## Status

🚧 **Work in Progress.**
This code represents the core structure. New public modules will be pushed as the project evolves.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install requirements (`discord.py`, `python-dotenv`).
3. Add your `.env` file.
4. Run `bot.py`.
